# Practical Tips

These suggestions help you get the most out of the OSCAR Export Analyzer and your therapy data.

## Analyze with Purpose

Before diving into charts, decide what question you want to answer. For example, “Did switching masks improve my AHI?” or “Is my usage declining on weekends?” Having a hypothesis guides which views to explore and avoids fishing for patterns.

## Use Range Comparisons After Changes

When you change equipment or settings, mark the date and use the **Range Comparisons** view to compare before and after periods. Look at both `ΔUsage` and `ΔAHI` along with effect size to judge whether the change had a meaningful impact.

## Correlate with a Sleep Diary

Quantitative data gains context when paired with qualitative notes. Keep a diary of mask issues, bedtime habits, or medication changes. Use the “bad nights” table in **AHI Trends** as a prompt to write down potential causes.

## Monitor Long‑Term Adherence

The calendar heatmap and 30‑night rolling averages in **Usage Patterns** reveal how habits evolve. Aim for at least 70 % of nights over four hours of usage. If you see a sustained decline, check equipment comfort or travel schedules.

## Investigate Clusters Carefully

Clusters of events might point to positional apnea or mask leaks. After identifying a severe cluster, open the timeline visualization, then return to OSCAR to inspect flow and pressure traces around that period. Avoid over‑interpreting a single night—look for recurring patterns.

## Share Reports with Professionals

Export the PDF report or aggregates CSV and bring them to clinical appointments. Visual summaries can make discussions more productive, but always defer to professional advice when considering therapy changes.

## Keep Raw Exports

Store original OSCAR exports alongside your session JSON files. Having raw data allows you to reproduce analyses later or try new tools without re‑exporting.

## Stay Up to Date

Check the project repository periodically for updates. New versions may include additional visualizations, bug fixes, or improved statistical methods.

## Respect Data Privacy

If using shared computers, disable **Remember data locally** (which clears cached data) and delete any exported session files after use. Sensitive health information should be handled carefully.
