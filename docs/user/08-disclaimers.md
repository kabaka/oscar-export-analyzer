# Disclaimers

The OSCAR Export Analyzer is designed for educational and exploratory purposes.  Understanding its limitations is essential before acting on any insights produced by the tool.

## Not a Medical Device
This software is **not** approved by regulatory agencies such as the FDA or CE for diagnosis or treatment.  Charts and statistics are approximations that may omit clinical context.  Always consult a qualified sleep specialist before altering therapy settings or equipment.

## Data Accuracy
- OSCAR exports depend on accurate device recordings.  Corrupted SD cards, incorrect clock settings, or device malfunctions can lead to misleading results.
- The analyzer performs basic validation but cannot detect every anomaly.  Review raw data in OSCAR when numbers appear implausible.

## Statistical Limitations
- Small sample sizes yield unstable estimates.  For example, a single bad night can skew averages dramatically.
- The analyzer uses non‑parametric tests and heuristics for convenience; they are not substitutes for clinical studies.
- Confidence intervals and `p`‑values rely on assumptions that may not hold for all datasets.

## Privacy and Security
- All processing occurs locally, but you are responsible for safeguarding exported reports and JSON snapshots.
- When sharing data, remove personally identifiable information and follow applicable privacy laws.

## No Warranty
The software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind.  The project maintainers are not liable for damages arising from use of the analyzer or reliance on its output.

By using the OSCAR Export Analyzer, you acknowledge these limitations and agree to use the tool responsibly.
