## FAQ

**Can I analyze nights without a Details CSV?**
Yes. Most views only require the Summary CSV. Event‑level analyses appear when a Details file is loaded.

**Why does a CSV fail to parse?**
Ensure the file is exported from OSCAR and uses UTF‑8 encoding. Very large files may require more memory.

**How is data stored?**
When "Remember data locally" is enabled, files and settings are saved to IndexedDB. Disable to remove local copies.

**Can I export results for my doctor?**
Use the print‑friendly report or aggregates CSV for sharing.
