# OSCAR Sleep Data Analysis Report

**Report Date**: 2025-07-02  
**Data Range**: 2024-09-17 to 2025-07-01

## 1. Usage Patterns

| Metric                      | Value                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Total nights analyzed       | 277                   |
| Average usage per night     | 6.24 hours            |
| Nights ≥ 4 h usage          | 238 (85.9 %)          |
| Nights < 4 h usage          | 39 (14.1 %)           |

## 2. Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) Trends

| Metric                      | Value                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Average AHI                 | 2.51 events/hour      |
| Min AHI                     | 0.00                  |
| Max AHI                     | 9.80                  |
| Nights with AHI > 5.0       | 10 (3.6 % of nights)  |

- **First 30 nights** (2024-09-17 to 2024-10-16): avg AHI = 4.06 events/hour  
- **Last 30 nights** (2025-06-02 to 2025-07-01): avg AHI = 2.17 events/hour  

### Observations

- AHI has shown a downward trend over time, indicating improved apnea control.

## 3. Pressure Settings and Performance

### 3.1 EPAP Trend

| Metric                                   | Value (cmH₂O) |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Avg median EPAP (first 30 nights)        | 5.36          |
| Avg median EPAP (last 30 nights)         | 7.41          |

- The device's auto-adjust EPAP median increased over the monitoring period.

### 3.2 EPAP vs AHI

| EPAP group      | Nights | Avg AHI (events/hour) |
| --------------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| EPAP < 7 cmH₂O  | 182    | 2.71                   |
| EPAP ≥ 7 cmH₂O  | 95     | 2.13                   |

- Higher EPAP (≥ 7 cmH₂O) is associated with a modest reduction in AHI.

## 4. Health Risk Assessment

- Overall average AHI (< 5 events/hour) falls within the mild or normal range.
- Only 3.6 % of nights exceeded the clinical threshold of AHI > 5.
- Good adherence and event suppression suggest low residual health risk.

## 5. Treatment Effectiveness

- Consistent nightly usage (~6.2 h/night) with average AHI ≈ 2.5 indicates effective therapy.
- Progressive titration of EPAP correlated with improved AHI control.

## 6. Recommendations & Future Evaluation Options

1. **Baseline Comparison**: Compare pre-therapy baseline AHI and usage metrics to quantify improvement.
2. **Event-Specific Analysis**: Integrate flow-limitation and leak-pattern data to refine algorithm settings.
3. **Symptom Correlation**: Collect daytime symptom scores (e.g., ESS) to correlate with residual AHI.
4. **Positional Dependence**: Investigate supine vs lateral sleep data for positional therapy adjustments.
5. **Long-Term Trends**: Automate monthly reports to track sustained improvements or regressions.
6. **Machine Learning**: Explore predictive modeling for anticipating nights at higher risk of residual events.
